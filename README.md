# FunctionsLib
I'm resolving here some algorithmic exercises and showing the solutions in methods which are devided 
on BasicFunctions, MediumFunctions and HardFunctions. 

The BasicFunctions class is the parent class and there are implemented the easiest code solutions.
MediumFunctions extends BasicFunctions and HardFunctions extends MediumFunctions.

Also this app become the Rest Api because I have implemented HttpServer which is one way
to create HTTP requests without using the SpringBoot.
I did it because in the final version I want to connect it with the front-end.

Now this app is under construction but all functions have been already tested with
JUnit5 and all should works correctly.
